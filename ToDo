Update the encryption code so that it also cna use AES. 
When an AES key is shared, it will operate in ctr mode.
We will use around 10-20 iterations before having to share a new key.

This will allow us to send encrypted messages faster by reducing the number of bytes that have to be emitted.

This will also allow us to send messages bigger than the RSA state size.
